# Swiss Army Cubemap
[![Run on Replit.com](https://replit.com/badge/github/hieyou1/swiss-army-cubemap)](https://replit.com/github/hieyou1/swiss-army-cubemap)

I couldn't find a reliable cubemap slicer, so I made one.

This is a super simple website built using Webpack. Upload a cubemap image to the site and it will download a ZIP of the split pngs, seperated into top, middle 1, 2, 3, and 4, and bottom.
